# **Rock or Mine Prediction Using Logistic Regression**
This is a simple machine learning project to predict whether a sonar object is a rock or a mine using logistic regression.

### **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains 208 instances with 60 features each. The label for each instance is either 'R' (rock) or 'M' (mine).

### **Prerequisites**
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
### **Usage**
* Clone the repository
* Install the required libraries
* Run the rock_or_mine.py file
You can change the input data in the input_data variable in the rock_or_mine.py file to make predictions for different instances.

### **Results**
The model achieved an accuracy of 86.54% on the test data.
